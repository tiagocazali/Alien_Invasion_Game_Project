```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

**1. Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tiagocazali/Game_Project.git
  ```

**2. Navigate to the game directory:**
  ```bash
  cd Game_Project
  ```

**3. Start the game:**
  ```bash
  python alien_invasion.py
  ```

**4. Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship and press the spacebar to shoot at the alien Invasion.**

**5. Press "q" to close de game.**



## Game Settings

You can customize the game by editing the settings in the "Settings.py" file. Here are some of the key settings that you can adjust:
ATTENTION: Some settings, if wrong configured, can make the game crash!

- **Screen Settings:**
  - `isFullScreen`: Set to `True` for fullscreen mode.
  - `screen_width` and `screen_height`: Adjust the screen size.

- **Ship Settings:**
  - `ship_lives`: Set the number of lives for your spaceship.

- **Bullet Settings:**
  - `bullet_width` and `bullet_height`: Adjust the bullet dimensions.
  - `bullet_color`: Change the bullet color.
  - `bullet_allowed`: Set the number of bullets allowed on the screen.

- **Aliens Setting:**
  - `fleet_drop_speed`: Adjust the speed at which the alien fleet moves down.
  - `speedup_scale`: Determines how quickly the game speeds up.
  - `score_scale`: Controls how quickly the alien point values increase.

- **Initialize Dynamic Settings:**
  - These settings control the dynamic aspects of the game, such as ship speed, bullet speed, alien speed, and more.

- **Increase Speed:**
  - The `increase_speed` method increases game speed settings to make the game more challenging.

Feel free to modify these settings in the "Settings.py" file to tailor the game to your preferences.
